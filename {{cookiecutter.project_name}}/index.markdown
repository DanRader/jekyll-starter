  text: 'It’s making a comeback. Cider is the original American beverage of choice,
    but it fell out of favor during Prohibition. We’re joining the national movement
    to reclaim cider for the States, and what better place to make our mark on Americana
    culture than in good ole Washington, DC? '

  title: Locally Sourced Ciders
  description: All our goods are sourced from within 200 miles of the US Capitol Building.
    We have a few of our own concoctions and many ciders from Mid-Atlantic producers
    that are otherwise hard to find in DC. Our menu is always changing, but we’re
    always keeping it local.

    Then we''re ready to press! One bushel yields about 2.5 gallons of delicious juice. '

  title: Ferment
  description: We add yeast and other natural ingredients, like honey or fruit juice,
    to our fresh apple juice. Then it's time to sit back and let nature take her course.
    The yeast gets to work, turning those natural sugars into alcohol and CO<sub>2</sub>.
